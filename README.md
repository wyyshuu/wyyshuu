Hi, I'm Vaishnavi.👋

I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in coding and problem solving. I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms and improving my skills in Java and C programming.

My goal is to build a strong technical foundation and secure a good software job in the future. I enjoy learning new concepts, working on projects, and improving a little every day.

### What I'm focusing on right now
- Strengthening my programming fundamentals
- Practicing DSA consistently
- Building small projects and learning by doing

### Outside academics
I like exploring new ideas, improving myself, and staying consistent toward my goals.
